# Customer Handling and Situation Analysis

We have mentioned below common situations which occur day to day handling the support. Please go through each of them and explain the actions you would take and dummy replies.

Client Name: John Doe

### **1.** Scope Creep Client

**Situation:** 

We often provide support to the client who request minor CSS or JS features which are not directly available in the plugins. Few clients always come back with such requests which can be solved by them. Imagine you've received a request from one such client and you have to patiently decline the request. Please write down a dummy reply you'll sent to that client as well as mention the thought process you've used.
